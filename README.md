# Stock-Digitization-System

Database management System that keeps track of all deadstock items in an organization.

Often Deadstock management in bigger organizations becomes severe task if it is handled via paper work. Everytime if new item is added or
updated or removed, updating entries becomes combursome task.

This application addresses this problem. It stores all the deadstock items in the database and addition/updation/deletion of items becomes much
easier with user friendly UI.

Also department wise or item wise reports can be printing by using this application.
